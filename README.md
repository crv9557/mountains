# mountains
CMP237 Extended example from Ch. 6

I changed "mountains.js" to fit with South American mountains, one from each country (exception for Ecuador). The program I wanted to create was a table that included the year that it was first successfully ascented. The problem that comes in is that when I created a file that would tell you how many years ago that the first ascent was achieved, I could not get it to run right.

In total, there are three files worth noting. "mountains.js", "printData.js", and "date.js" are the 3 files in that are supposed to run. However, I could not get "date.js" to work correctly. All of these are meant to run on d8.
